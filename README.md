## 📈 Fuzzy Expert System for Stock Portfolio Selection 🤖
- 🌟 Overview
  - This project implements a novel Fuzzy Expert System 🧠 designed for optimal stock portfolio selection. The system leverages fuzzy logic and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory 📊 for rule construction, along with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) 🐜 for model optimization. The primary goal is to allocate investor assets among various stocks to maximize returns 📈 while minimizing risk 📉.

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🧩 Fuzzy Rule Construction using DS-Theory: Implements Dempster-Shafer theory to handle uncertainty and combine evidence from multiple factors efficiently, reducing implementation time and cost ⏱️💰.
- 🎯 Defuzzification: Converts fuzzy output into crisp values for actionable investment decisions ✅.
- 🚀 Optimization using ACO: Utilizes Ant Colony Optimization to maximize the objective function: (fuzzy portfolio return - risk free return) / weighted mean semi-variance 📊➗.

## 📋 Factors Considered
The system evaluates stocks based on the following factors, each with its geometric mean as derived from historical data:

- SI No.	Factor	Geometric Mean (M_F)
  - 1️⃣	Earn per share	7.17
  - 2️⃣	Payout ratio	7.00
  - 3️⃣	Price to earning ratio	8.43
  - 4️⃣	Price to sales ratio	8.35
  - 5️⃣	Current ratio	6.02
  - 6️⃣	Price to book value ratio	8.26
  - 7️⃣	Price to cash flow ratio	6.59
  - 8️⃣	Profit margin	6.52
  - 9️⃣	Long term debt to equity ratio	8.20
  - 🔟	Accounts receivable turnover	5.81

## ⚙️ How It Works
- 📥 Input Processing: The system takes stock data and applies fuzzy logic to handle imprecise or uncertain information.
- 🧠 Rule Construction: Using Dempster-Shafer theory, rules are constructed to combine evidence from the listed factors.
- 🎯 Defuzzification: The fuzzy outputs are converted into crisp values to determine the optimal stock allocation.
- 🚀 Optimization: ACO is applied to refine the model, ensuring maximum return with minimal risk.
